- Untar the file `tar xvf derogold-bootstrap.tar` to your DeroGold's daemon `--data-dir` (inside the `.DeroGold` directory (or whatever alternative name you use for your DeroGold data dir)
- Start your DeroGoldd daemon pointing to the data directory where you just untar-ed the bootstrap.
- The DeroGoldd daemon will use the DB bootstrap and sync up the delta between the bootsrap last block and the network top block.

Keep in mind the file is over 305GB large! 
It may take several hours to download.
Yet, downloading and using the bootstrap file will 100% be much faster to get your node synced with the DeroGold network than syncing from scratch with or without checkpoints.
